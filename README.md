Kill Bill tax plugin for [Avalara AvaTax](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/products/calculations.html).

This integration delegates computation of sales taxes to Avalara, which will appear directly on Kill Bill invoices.

The easiest way to get started with the AvaTax plugin is to take a look at our [AvaTax plugin Manual](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/avatax-plugin) which provides detailed instructions for installing, configuring and using the plugin.

## Requirements

The plugin needs a database. The latest version of the schema can be found [here](https://github.com/killbill/killbill-avatax-plugin/blob/master/src/main/resources/ddl.sql).

## Development

To install the plugin from sources:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
kpm install_java_plugin avatax --from-source-file target/avatax-plugin-*-SNAPSHOT.jar --destination /var/tmp/bundles
```

You must then enable globally the plugin in Kill Bill (`killbill.properties` file):

```
org.killbill.invoice.plugin=killbill-avatax
```

## Configuration

The AvaTax plugin requires some properties to be configured either globally or on a per-tenant basis. 

The following properties are mandatory:

* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.url`: AvaTax endpoint (e.g. https://sandbox-rest.avatax.com/api/v2)
* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.accountId`: your AvaTax account number
* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.licenseKey`: your license key

The following properties are optional:

* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.companyCode`: your default company code (can be passed using the plugin property `companyCode`)
* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.commitDocuments`: whether invoices should be committed to Avalara
* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.adjustments.lenientMode`, when true Avatax-plugin skips any adjustment items from Invoice for which the previousInvoiceId is not present (i.e. missing) or else leads to IllegalStateException and fails to generate invoice
* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.proxyHost`: proxy host
* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.proxyPort`: proxy port
* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.strictSSL`: if false, unverified certificates are trusted
* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.connectTimeout`: maximum time in millisecond the client can wait when connecting to a remote host
* `org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.requestTimeout`: maximum time in millisecond the client waits until the response is completed

These properties can be specified globally via System Properties or on a per-tenant basis:

```
curl -v \
     -X POST \
     -u admin:password \
     -H 'X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob' \
     -H 'X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar' \
     -H 'X-Killbill-CreatedBy: admin' \
     -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
     -d 'org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.url=XXX
org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.accountId=YYY
org.killbill.billing.plugin.avatax.licenseKey=ZZZ' \
     http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/tenants/uploadPluginConfig/killbill-avatax
```

Refer to the [Avatax Plugin Manual](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/avatax-plugin#plugin_configuration) for further details.

## AvaTax tax calculation details

Taxes are calculated by default using the address specified on the Kill Bill account (set as the `shipTo` element). In case your current e-commerce application doesn't validate addresses, you can use [Avalara's Address Validation service](https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/address-validation/) to do it (Avalara will implicitly validate addresses during the tax calculation and fail the invoice creation if the address is invalid).

You can also specify a location code per line item by passing the `locationCode_<INVOICE_ITEM_ID>` plugin property.

Kill Bill will send to Avalara all invoice line items: make sure to configure in the plugin the tax codes associated with your catalog products (see below).

Dry run invoices will contain a preview of the tax items (the associated document won't be committed to Avalara).

Here is how the main Avalara fields map to Kill Bill:

* Customer Code is mapped to the Kill Bill account external key if present, the account id otherwise
* Description is mapped to the Kill Bill invoice id
* Line item number is mapped to the Kill Bill invoice item id
* Line item code is mapped to the Kill Bill invoice item description, or the plan, phase or usage name (first non null)
* Line item Ref1 is mapped to the Kill Bill invoice item id
* Line item Ref2 is mapped to the Kill Bill invoice id

Documents in Avalara are not automatically voided (as this will depend on your dunning configuration).

See also the [AvaTax Kaui Integration](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/avatax-plugin#_kaui_integration), which helps you administrate the plugin via Kaui.

### Marking an account as tax exempt

The plugin allows accounts to be exempted from tax.  Set the `customerUsageType` custom field on the account object (e.g. `E` for charitable or benevolent organizations).

See [Marking an Account as Tax Exempt](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/avatax-plugin#_marking_an_account_as_tax_exempt) for further details.

### Skipping Tax Calculation

You can skip an account entirely by setting the plugin property `AVALARA_SKIP` at runtime (the plugin property value doesn't matter, it just cannot be blank). See [Skipping Taxation](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/avatax-plugin#_skipping_taxation) for further details.

### Setting tax codes

The plugin allows setting tax codes on products. This allows taxing products differently. See [Tax Calculation by Product Tax Code](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/avatax-plugin#_tax_calculation_by_product_tax_code) for further details.

There are several ways to configure tax codes:

* Set the `taxCode_<INVOICE_ITEM_ID>` plugin property
* Set the `taxCode` custom field on the invoice item object
* Store the tax code in the plugin for each product in your catalog via  [Tax Code APIs](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/avatax-plugin#_tax_code_apis)

### Transactions API

The plugin offers convenient pass-through APIs to retrieve, commit, and void documents. These are documented in the [AvaTax manual](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/avatax-plugin#_transaction_apis).
